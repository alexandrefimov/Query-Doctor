# Code Map

Last updated: 2026-06-24

This is the practical lookup map for coding agents. Use it to find the likely
owner of a behavior before reading large modules.

## Product Surfaces

| Surface | Primary code | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Diagnose UI: Recent queries, Running now, Known Query ID | `query_doctor/web/`, `query_doctor/recent/` | Web routes and presenters should keep browser output safe. |
| Details pages | `query_doctor/web/ui/recent_scan_details.py`, `query_doctor/web/presenters/`, `query_doctor/web/trusted_artifacts.py` | Keep data assembly, trusted artifact loading, presentation, and rendering separate. |
| Reports | `query_doctor/report/`, `query_doctor/cli/report.py` | Python Report is the deterministic baseline; optional LLM narrative owns wording only after validation. |
| Query LLM optimizer | `query_doctor/optimizer/`, `query_doctor/cli/optimize_query.py`, `query_doctor/web/trusted_artifacts.py` | Trusted SQL drafts require deterministic validation and current markers. |
| Pasted-SQL Query Optimizer | `query_doctor/optimizer/`, `query_doctor/web/` | Read-only parse/analyze only. Do not echo submitted SQL after submit. |
| Cloudera Manager collection | `query_doctor/cm/`, `query_doctor/cli/collect_cm_profiles.py` | Explicit, bounded, read-only, redacted. |
| Direct Impala daemon collection | `query_doctor/impala/`, `query_doctor/recent/`, `query_doctor/cli/collect_impala_profile.py` | Bounded Recent, Running, and one Known Query ID profile source; optional JSON profile, `/profile_docs`, and `/admission?json` probes; no Cloudera Manager events. |
| Engine capability manifest | `query_doctor/engines/capabilities.py`, `query_doctor/engines/base.py`, `query_doctor/cli/commands.py`, `query_doctor/web/preview_surfaces.py`, `pyproject.toml` | Machine-checkable product/preview/dev-gate capability graph. Adapter flags, second-engine CLI roles, isolated preview routes, and Trino/Spark script taxonomy should stay aligned with this manifest. |
| Trino browser/report regression audit | `query_doctor/trino/browser_report_regression.py`, `scripts/audit_trino_browser_report_regression.py` | Dev-only raw-free closure-gate audit over the required browser/report test catalog, materialized route capabilities, adapter flags, blocked raw-output classes, per test/route/product-surface requirement tracking, and `production_review_browser_report_v1` profile tracking. It does not render pages, load artifacts, collect from Trino, generate SQL, execute SQL, or promote broader support. |
| Spark compact History Server intake and evidence packages | `query_doctor/spark/`, `query_doctor/analyzer/engine_intake_primitives.py`, `query_doctor/analyzer/engine_redaction_note.py`, `query_doctor/analyzer/spark_evidence_package.py`, `query_doctor/analyzer/spark_evidence_package_builder.py`, `query_doctor/cli/collect_spark_history.py`, `query_doctor/cli/diagnose_spark_compact.py`, `query_doctor/cli/build_spark_evidence_package.py`, `query_doctor/cli/validate_spark_evidence_package.py`, `query_doctor/cli/export_spark_evidence_fixtures.py`, `query_doctor/safety/manifest_references.py`, `scripts/spark_evidence_package_requirements.py`, `scripts/spark_one_application_handoff.py`, `scripts/build_spark_one_application_handoff_suite_manifest.py`, `scripts/build_spark_evidence_package_from_one_application_suite.py`, `scripts/audit_spark_compact_readiness.py`, `scripts/audit_spark_product_surface_boundary.py`, `scripts/audit_spark_evidence_handoff.py`, `scripts/build_spark_handoff_suite_manifest.py`, `scripts/audit_spark_support_boundary.py`, `query_doctor/web/preview_surfaces.py`, `query_doctor/web/spark_compact.py`, `query_doctor/web/ui/spark.py`, `query_doctor/engines/spark.py` | Registered bounded summary-only `/api/v1` intake plus local CLI/direct preview web collect-and-diagnose, shared bounded JSON intake primitives and package-style `redaction_note_v1` validation for evidence-package wrappers, shared safe relative JSON manifest reference checks for retained handoff-suite artifacts, dev-only requirements printing from the Python-owned evidence package contract, dev-only one-application handoff wrapper over the same bounded History Server compact path with optional product-surface summary audit over the written compact/diagnosis artifacts, dev-only one-application handoff-suite manifest metadata over retained raw-free compact/diagnosis/boundary artifact triples and optional matching `spark_one_application_handoff_summary_v1` and `spark_product_surface_boundary_audit_v1` artifacts, optional raw-free compact readiness summary JSON for suite audit output, dev-only product-surface boundary audit over retained compact/diagnosis artifacts or one-application handoff manifests, dev-only one-application-suite-to-package bridge that rechecks diagnosis/boundary/summary consistency before building a sanitized evidence package wrapper, local compact evidence-package build/validation, fixture-ready compact sample export with a safe manifest, strict package-to-fixture handoff audit for raw-free Spark fact-contract shaping with retained diagnostic-lane checked/readiness/source-granularity/verification-scope and fact-state counters, dev-only handoff-suite manifest metadata over retained raw-free handoff summaries, and a static support-boundary audit with optional `spark_support_boundary_audit_v1` summary output that keeps the Spark adapter compact-only while checking Spark CLI roles, support docs, and Details/report/optimizer/recent imports below production product support; includes optional application lifecycle/attempt-state facts, source coverage warning IDs, application attempt counts, aggregate job-state counts, executor loss/churn aggregates, explicit dynamic-allocation markers from executor summaries, and raw-free Spark version-family facts; no Recent workflow, Details/trusted report surface, optimizer behavior, raw event-log download, raw SQL/plan/log/environment collection, or Spark job execution. |
| Prometheus runtime metrics | `query_doctor/prometheus/`, `query_doctor/impala/`, analyzer runtime metrics modules | Optional bounded runtime context for configured direct Impala workflows; allowlisted PromQL only. |
| Impala metadata | `query_doctor/impala/` | Allowlisted `SHOW` statements only. |
| Analyzer facts and scoring | `query_doctor/analyzer/`, `query_doctor/recent/` | Deterministic facts, score reasons, and action candidates. |

| Dev-only handoff artifact safety | `query_doctor/safety/handoff_artifacts.py`, `scripts/*handoff*.py` | Shared path-overlap checks and ASCII/sorted JSON artifact writing for retained raw-free handoff summaries and compact artifacts. Engine-specific redaction checks, readiness gates, and support-boundary wording remain in the owning Trino/Spark scripts. |
| Engine fact contract and Trino intake | `query_doctor/analyzer/engine_facts.py`, `query_doctor/analyzer/engine_fact_promotion_policy.py`, `query_doctor/analyzer/engine_fact_consumer.py`,

`scripts/audit_trino_compact_readiness.py`, `tests/engine_fact_contract_harness.py` | Typed normalized facts, explicit fact namespace registration, checked promotion-policy registry for shared/distributed-SQL-family/source-boundary/support-boundary facts, raw-free boundary payloads, shared bounded JSON intake primitives and package-style `redaction_note_v1` validation for evidence-package wrappers, shared safe relative JSON manifest reference checks for retained handoff-suite artifacts, source-contract/source-type registry for accepted bounded local production and preview source kinds, production collector closure-gate audit over existing local lanes, preview readers, contract-only sources, open blockers, and optional retained representative-evidence summary handoff checks that require the production_review_breadth_v1 ready profile, representative-evidence closure-gate audit over already retained raw-free summary-counter payload breadth with the production_review_breadth_v1 profile, query-linked fact coverage closure-gate audit over bounded compact facts and open operator/split/telemetry blockers, product metadata collection closure-gate

closure-gate audit over the support-gap gate list, Trino dev-gate capability wiring, retained closure tracking summaries, and collector-to-representative-evidence linkage with raw-free

| Browser safety | `query_doctor/safety/browser_display.py`, web presenters | Dynamic browser text should cross this boundary. |

Trino production closure gate tracking also emits raw-free per-gate
`gate_tracking` entries and aggregate `gate_tracking` counts for accepted,
missing, invalid, and not-required retained tracking inputs; the CLI prints the
same path-free counts and reports `bounded_production_claim_ready` only for a
complete accepted retained summary bundle, without collecting from Trino,
executing SQL, or promoting broader/shared expansion.

Trino production collector contract tracking also emits raw-free
`source_requirement_tracking` entries and aggregate
`source_requirement_tracking` counts for accepted, missing, and invalid
collector source requirements, plus auth-reference policy, source-schema gate,
retry-policy, fail-closed policy, reader-status, reader-scope, CLI-role,
capability, and forbidden-reader counters; the CLI prints the same path-free
tracking, policy, and reader counts while keeping the collector gate
`not_closed`.

Trino representative evidence tracking also emits raw-free
`breadth_requirement_tracking` entries and aggregate
`breadth_requirement_tracking` counts for accepted, insufficient, and
not-required retained breadth requirements, including retained summary-kind mix
and accepted input-status requirements for the production-review profile; the
CLI prints the same path-free summary-kind and breadth counts while keeping the
representative evidence gate `not_closed`.

Trino query-linked fact coverage tracking also emits raw-free
`query_linked_requirement_tracking` entries and aggregate
`query_linked_requirement_tracking` counts for accepted, missing, and invalid
fact/source requirements, source-granularity counts, and
`production_review_query_linked_v1` coverage-profile tracking for required
core fact families, query-linked scopes, one-query source granularities, and
retained operator/split-detail/telemetry blockers, plus
`operator_connector_telemetry_decision_v1` tracking that keeps connector metric
signal bounded-supported and operator-level, split-detail, and telemetry
linkage as deliberate unsupported gaps; the CLI prints the same path-free
counts while keeping the query-linked coverage gate `not_closed`.

Trino product metadata collection tracking also emits raw-free
`product_metadata_requirement_tracking` entries and aggregate
`product_metadata_requirement_tracking` counts for accepted, missing, and
invalid fact/source/product-surface requirements, plus
`production_review_metadata_v1` tracking for allowlist/source lanes,
aggregate-only metadata boundary, metadata fact namespace, bounded sources,
redaction blocks, explicit metadata SQL policy, product-surface blocks, and the
retained product-metadata open blocker; the CLI prints the same path-free
counts while keeping product metadata collection unsupported.

Trino report and optimizer safety tracking also emits raw-free
`report_optimizer_requirement_tracking` entries and aggregate
`report_optimizer_requirement_tracking_counts` for accepted, missing, and
invalid capability/policy/validator/product-surface requirements, plus
`production_review_report_optimizer_v1` tracking for report/guidance families,
materialized capabilities, raw-source policy fields, validator sentinel matrix,
and blocked product-surface requirements; the CLI prints the same path-free
counts while keeping the report optimizer safety gate `not_closed`.

Trino browser/report regression tracking also emits raw-free
`browser_report_requirement_tracking` entries and aggregate
`browser_report_requirement_tracking_counts` for accepted, missing, and invalid
test/route/product-surface requirements, plus
`production_review_browser_report_v1` tracking for regression families, test
files, materialized route capabilities, raw-output blocks, unsupported-surface
blocks, download regressions, and public-claim regressions; the CLI prints the
same path-free requirement and production-review counts while keeping the
browser/report regression gate `not_closed`.

Trino metadata CLI summary ownership also includes
`query_doctor/trino/metadata_cli_summary.py`,
`query_doctor/trino/local_metadata_summary.py`,
`query_doctor/cli/trino_metadata_cli_summary.py`, and the dev-only
`scripts/trino_metadata_cli_summary_smoke.py` round-trip gate, with
`scripts/audit_trino_product_metadata_collection.py` tracking the current
product metadata collection closure gate from only the metadata source registry,
metadata fact namespace, adapter flags, and product-surface blocks. That path
writes only raw-free smoke or aggregate metadata summaries and remains outside
Recent, Details, trusted reports, optimizer behavior, Running scans,
query-history crawling, product metadata collection, generated SQL, and user SQL
execution.

Trino shared/non-local deployment hardening ownership includes
`scripts/audit_trino_shared_deployment_boundary.py`,
`scripts/audit_trino_shared_deployment_preflight.py`,
`scripts/audit_owner_raw_live_front_door_review.py`, and
[trino-shared-deployment-hardening.md](trino-shared-deployment-hardening.md).
It remains a dev-only static/config-shape and preflight gate for trusted
front-door identity, explicit operator front-door review confirmation,
machine-checkable raw-free live proxy review summaries, and raw-source
isolation. The shared boundary audit records raw-free
`shared_deployment_requirement_tracking` entries and
`shared_deployment_requirement_tracking_counts` for deployment-config,
product-boundary, capability, release-gate, and documentation requirements,
plus `production_review_shared_deployment_v1` tracking for review families,
deployment-config requirements, product-boundary requirements, capability
requirements, release requirements, doc requirements, and unsupported-surface
blocks. It is not broader/shared production support.

Trino package-level retained evidence-handoff suite audits can also require
selected source-contract, connector-family, diagnostic-lane source-granularity,
and verification-scope labels through
`scripts/audit_trino_evidence_handoff.py --handoff-suite-manifest`.
`scripts/audit_trino_representative_evidence.py`
aggregates already raw-free handoff/readiness summaries for the representative
real-cluster evidence closure gate. Both remain dev-only retained metadata and
do not create live or product Trino surfaces.

## Common Change Targets

### Add Or Change A Details Block

Start with:

- `query_doctor/web/presenters/`;
- `query_doctor/web/ui/recent_scan_details.py`;
- `query_doctor/web/trusted_artifacts.py` if the block depends on report or
  optimizer trust state.

Do not pass raw domain objects directly to HTML helpers when a presenter/view
model can own safe display text.

### Add A Report Claim Or Section

Start with:

- `query_doctor/report/`;
- `query_doctor/cli/report.py`;
- report sanitizer/validator tests.

The claim should be backed by analyzer facts before prompt or wording changes.

### Add An Optimizer Recipe

Start with:

- `query_doctor/optimizer/`;
- `query_doctor/cli/optimize_query.py`;
- `tests/fixtures/optimizer_cases/`;
- `docs/query-optimizer-contract.md`.

Add accepted and rejected fixtures. A recipe should document what it preserves,
not just what it rewrites.

### Change Cloudera Manager Metrics Or Events

Start with:

- `query_doctor/cm/`;
- `query_doctor/analyzer/`;
- `query_doctor/web/presenters/` if surfaced in browser output;
- `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/demo-data-engineer-brief.md` if user-facing
  meaning changes.

Metrics and events are runtime context unless analyzer facts support a stronger
claim.

### Change Metadata Collection

Start with:

- `query_doctor/impala/`;
- analyzer metadata fact rendering;
- recent scan metadata policy and candidate scoring tests.

Keep metadata status distinct: `not_requested`, `partial`, `failed`,
`insufficient_metadata`, and collected-but-not-proof.

### Change Batch Or Progress Behavior

Start with:

- `query_doctor/recent/`;
- `query_doctor/cli/batch_recent.py`;
- `query_doctor/web/jobs.py`;
- Details progress rendering.

Keep analyzer, metadata, metrics, events, report, and optimizer stages
separately bounded and safely reported.

## Trust Boundaries

| Boundary | Owner | What to protect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Raw collection to local case | `query_doctor/cm`, `query_doctor/impala`, `query_doctor/spark` | Bounds, redaction, read-only source access. |
| Local case to analyzer facts | `query_doctor/analyzer` | Deterministic facts, limitations, no unsupported root causes. |
| Analyzer facts to report | `query_doctor/report` | Prompt scope, sanitizer, validator, trusted report marker. |
| Source SQL to optimizer result | `query_doctor/optimizer`, `query_doctor/cli/optimize_query.py` | Read-only scope, semantic guards, recipe checks, trust marker. |
| Trusted artifacts to browser | `query_doctor/web/trusted_artifacts.py` | Marker validity, stale artifacts, safe recommendation text. |
| Dynamic text to browser | `query_doctor/safety/browser_display.py`, presenters | No raw SQL/profile/metadata/paths/artifact names/model names. |

## Where Not To Put Logic

- Do not put collector source rules in UI modules.
- Do not put browser display policy in collectors.
- Do not put optimizer trust in prompts.
- Do not put report facts in LLM wording.
- Do not add fake engine support under `engines/`.
- Do not create placeholder packages without current callers.

## Command Entrypoints

Current docs and subprocess builders should use packaged console scripts or
`python -m query_doctor.cli.<module>`. Root-level prototype commands are not
current product entrypoints.
