# Engine Expansion Plan

Last reviewed: 2026-06-03

This document records the transition plan for future source-provider and engine
work. Current production triage is still Apache Impala. Trino support is
limited to sanitized offline evidence package import, bounded local event-store
import, bounded HTTP event archive import, bounded HTTP query-detail archive
import, bounded local query-detail import, and bounded local query-list
aggregate import, plus bounded local statement-stats import, event-source
contract checking, dry-run coordinator query-info target checking, and bounded
pruned coordinator query-info probing plus one-query pruned coordinator fact
import, plus local compact diagnosis over raw-free direct boundary JSON or
selected package sample boundaries. Cloudera Manager is the full
query/profile/metrics/events source for Impala, while direct Impala daemon
collection and optional
Prometheus runtime metrics are implemented only for the bounded workflows
described below.

The goal is to avoid doing provider decoupling, engine abstraction, new metrics
sources, and a second engine in one step. Apache Impala upstream work around
native AI profile analysis makes cross-engine production triage more important
as a long-term differentiator, but it does not relax the readiness gates below.
Each phase has its own stop conditions. Early second-engine exploration may
start before live-support gates are complete, but only as a bounded
contract-shaping path with explicit limitations and no default live workflow
impact.

## Current Position

- `query_doctor/engines/` is a thin metadata seam, not a full parser or analyzer
  abstraction.
- Current full collection is coupled to Cloudera Manager for query discovery,
  profile collection, metrics, and events. Direct Impala daemon collection now
  supports bounded Recent, Running, and Known Query ID profile workflows without
  Cloudera Manager events.
- Current profile parsing and many analyzer facts are Impala-profile specific.
- Impala metadata collection is already mostly separate from Cloudera Manager,
  but it remains Impala-specific.

This is acceptable while Impala is the only implemented engine. Future work
should extract behavior only when there is implemented behavior behind the
boundary.

The strategic direction is a Big Data SQL/lakehouse diagnostic workbench, not an
Impala-only clone of native Web UI analysis. The implementation path still
starts from Impala facts because that is the only engine with real collection,
parser, analyzer, and browser/report safety coverage today.

## Gate Types

Separate two decisions:

- **Exploration gate:** a small second-engine spike may start when it has a
  named engine, real or synthetic-safe artifacts, a specific contract question
  to answer, and no path to browser/report output without safety tests.
- **Support claim gate:** README, package metadata, UI copy, and support
  matrices must distinguish offline evidence import from live engine support.
  They must not claim live support for a second engine until real collection or
  fixture coverage, parser/fact mapping, metadata allowlists, browser/report
  safety tests, and a support gap matrix exist.

Do not start broad provider or product engine expansion until all of these are
true:

- core Impala diagnosis is useful on representative real workloads;
- `case_primary_bottleneck = unknown` is below roughly 30% for normal Impala
  diagnosis work;
- optimizer funnel metrics show non-zero trusted SQL draft production for
  recipe-supported cases;
- design partners confirm that the current product is useful enough to justify
  expanding its deployment surface.

Do not claim live supported second-engine behavior until every support gate in
[roadmap.md](roadmap.md) is true. A bounded offline or local import path can
happen earlier if it has deterministic parsers, raw-free outputs, explicit
limitations, and no live/query-execution behavior.

## Phase 1: Direct Impala Profile Source And Metrics Source

First expand away from Cloudera Manager, not away from Impala.

The first Direct Impala slice is intentionally narrow and implemented:

- support bounded Recent and Running query-list/profile collection from Impala
  daemon debug endpoints;
- support one explicit known query/profile fetch from an Impala daemon
  debug/profile endpoint;
- support optional explicit Prometheus runtime metrics for configured direct
  Impala workflow windows;
- stay read-only, bounded, redacted, and explicit;
- keep browser and trusted-report output raw-free;
- support enterprise auth requirements, including Kerberos, before claiming the
  provider is useful for real deployments;
- document that Prometheus metrics are not discovery or event support and are
  context-only unless correlated with deterministic profile evidence.

Use small source interfaces instead of one large provider object:

- `ProfileSource`: fetch one explicit profile and safe query context.
- `QueryDiscoverySource`: list bounded candidate queries.
- `MetricsSource`: publish normalized bounded metric facts.
- `EventSource`: publish normalized bounded event facts.

Cloudera Manager can implement all four over time. Direct Impala currently
implements bounded query discovery/profile collection and can use an optional
Prometheus `MetricsSource`; it still does not implement events.

Do not add event/log providers or a second engine in this phase.
Do not rewrite `query_doctor/cm/` for neatness; wrap existing behavior only as
far as needed to create a tested boundary.

Done for the current baseline means at least one real non-Cloudera-Manager
Impala deployment can diagnose bounded Recent/Running queries and one known
query safely, with optional bounded Prometheus runtime metrics, fixtures, and
browser/report safety tests. Follow-up hardening should add more sanitized
real fixtures and profile action cards before broader provider claims.

## Phase 2: Engine Fact Contract

Refactor Impala parsing and analysis behind an engine-owned parser output. The
contract should normalize parser outputs, not profile inputs.

The first contract-shaping slice now exists as
`query_doctor/analyzer/engine_facts.py`, an Impala projection module, a Trino
mapper, a packaged Trino offline evidence import path, a bounded local Trino
event-store import path, a bounded HTTP Trino event archive import path, a
bounded local Trino query-detail import path, and a bounded local Trino
query-list aggregate import path, plus a raw-free Trino event-source contract
check. Trino remains isolated from live product workflows: no Trino coordinator
collection, metadata, browser report, or optimizer path consumes it. Track current gaps in
[engine-support-gap-matrix.md](engine-support-gap-matrix.md).

Target shape:

- engine-specific parser input: raw profile payload plus bounded provider
  context;
- engine-specific parser output: typed engine profile facts with explicit
  support and null semantics;
- analyzer input: normalized facts, not raw Impala profile text;
- finding IDs and fact fields carry enough engine context to avoid pretending
  every engine has the same counters.

This phase should keep Impala behavior stable. Existing Impala tests should pass
through the new contract before any second engine is supported.

Do not add live second-engine behavior during this refactor. A bounded offline
or local import path for one named candidate engine is allowed when it answers a
contract question, stays isolated from normal workflows, and cannot render
browser/report output without safety tests. The goal is to prevent the first
non-Impala engine from becoming an Impala-shaped copy.

Done means the analyzer service no longer depends on Impala-specific profile
parsing internals, Impala fixtures still pass, and the fact contract documents
field semantics and unsupported-field behavior.

## Phase 3A: Experimental Second-Engine Offline And Local Import

Choose the second engine from design partner demand, not from a static wishlist.
The first step is discovery and offline import, not live support.

Trino is the default candidate to validate because it is a common migration
destination from legacy Hadoop and Cloudera environments, and it supports a
local-first diagnostic model better than closed platforms. This is a candidate,
not a public live-support commitment. The first spike is documented in
[trino-discovery-spike.md](trino-discovery-spike.md), and the future evidence
contract is documented in
[engines/trino-diagnostic-contract.md](engines/trino-diagnostic-contract.md).

Spark SQL remains outside product support under the current product state. Its
useful diagnostic surface depends on applications, SQL executions, jobs, stages,
tasks, executor behavior, event history, and logs rather than the Impala-style
runtime profile model. A research-only Spark architecture spike may start to
define the source contract, compact fixture schema, and fact envelope described
in [engines/spark-architecture-spike.md](engines/spark-architecture-spike.md).
The current Spark slice includes an experimental bounded History Server
compact-intake CLI plus an isolated direct compact-diagnosis page for one
explicit History Server application or already accepted raw-free JSON. The
collector reads only summary `/api/v1` JSON and maps it to raw-free normalized
facts. The page renders only endpoint counts, warning IDs, deterministic
attention areas, limitations, and verification direction, without echoing
request selectors or submitted JSON. This remains below product support and
must not add Spark engine registration, Recent workflows, Details/trusted
report surfaces, optimizer behavior, raw event-log downloads, raw SQL/plan/log
or environment collection, Spark job execution, or a support claim.

An experimental offline import path must:

- use sanitized or synthetic-safe artifacts or operator-reviewed local packages,
  not live cluster reads by default;
- map only a small set of parser outputs into the engine fact contract;
- preserve explicit `supported`, `not_observed`, and `unknown` semantics;
- avoid adding live runtime engine selectors, placeholder packages, or default
  product routes;
- include redaction and raw-free contract tests before any output reaches
  report or browser code;
- document what the spike proves and what remains unsupported.

Done means the path teaches the engine fact contract something concrete and
does not change current Impala behavior or live support claims.

## Phase 3B: Supported Second Engine

A supported second engine requires:

- engine-specific source and profile/parser fixtures;
- engine-specific metadata allowlists;
- explicit bounded read-only collection contracts before any live collection;
- normalized facts mapped into the engine fact contract;
- finding coverage that distinguishes shared findings from engine-specific
  findings;
- browser/report safety tests;
- a documented support gap matrix.

Do not update public README language to imply multi-engine support until the
engine has real fixtures, safety coverage, and working diagnosis paths.

## Phase 4: Prometheus Metrics Source Expansion

Prometheus-style metrics are a metrics-source expansion, not an engine
expansion. The first slice is implemented for configured direct Impala
workflows. Broader expansion, such as additional metric profiles or non-Impala
providers, can run in parallel with second-engine work only if the provider
interfaces from Phase 1 are stable.

Requirements:

- allowlisted PromQL only;
- fixed query windows;
- response-size limits;
- normalized facts only;
- no raw time-series, labels, provider JSON, or query text in browser-visible
  output or trusted reports.

## Phase 5: Storage And Table-Format Facts

Storage and table-format context is a third axis, separate from query engine and
source provider. Future facts may cover HDFS, object storage, Apache Kudu,
Apache Iceberg, Apache Hudi, Delta Lake, and engine-internal analytical storage.

Defer this axis until provider and engine boundaries have stabilized. When it
starts, publish bounded normalized facts such as file-count, file-size, pruning,
manifest, clustering, compaction, or layout signals. Do not pass raw storage
metadata to LLM prompts or browser UI.

## Non-Goals

- No placeholder engine packages.
- No fake adapters that claim support without parser, analyzer, fixture, and
  safety coverage.
- No broad runtime engine selector before engine-specific collectors, parsers,
  metadata, and tests exist.
- No public "coming soon" promises for Trino or any other engine.
- No storage/table-format root-cause claims without deterministic facts.
