# Query Doctor Roadmap

Last updated: 2026-05-25

Required reading before any PR: hard rules in `AGENTS.md`,
`docs/agent-quickstart.md`, Product Direction, and the Near-Term Priorities
section relevant to the touched area. Other sections are reference.

This roadmap tracks active product direction. It is not a support matrix and it
is not a historical audit log. For engineering risks, use
[code-audit.md](code-audit.md). For architecture boundaries, use
[architecture.md](architecture.md). For optimizer trust rules, use
[query-optimizer-contract.md](query-optimizer-contract.md).

## Current Scope

- Apache Impala is the only implemented SQL engine.
- Query Doctor is positioned as a local-first Big Data query diagnostic tool
  focused today on Impala production triage, not as a generic AI query profile
  analyzer.
- Cloudera Manager is the full implemented query discovery, profile, metrics,
  and events source for Recent queries.
- Direct Impala daemon collection supports bounded Recent scans, Running scans,
  and one explicit Known Query ID through daemon query-list/profile endpoints.
  It does not provide Cloudera Manager events. It can optionally collect
  bounded Prometheus runtime metrics when explicitly configured.
- Direct Impala diagnosis now extracts raw-free profile format,
  source provenance, resource balance, per-node read/user/system time, Query
  Timeline, and fragment lifecycle timing facts, and can use profile resource
  and timing signals in Runtime Diagnosis.
- Diagnose is the primary UI screen.
- Recent Scan is the flagship workflow for production triage across many
  queries.
- Recent queries is the default Diagnose mode.
- Finished queries is the default completed-query scan target.
- Running now is a lower-confidence live scan target inside Recent queries.
- Known Query ID is the secondary Diagnose mode for one known Impala query ID.
- Recent results now include raw-free workload diagnostics for repeated,
  frequent-short, and regressed workload fingerprints, plus workload detail
  pages, admin pool/owner digests, an analyst action queue, and compact action
  outcome rollups.
- Details pages show deterministic findings and explicit LLM Report / Query LLM
  optimizer actions.
- Help, Details static UI copy, and newly generated trusted reports are
  controlled by the global `language` config. English is the default; Russian
  remains a localized companion mode, not a separately generated second report.
- Finished-query Scan date/hour selection reads `recent_scan_timezone` from
  config, renders the current UTC offset in the Scan Hour label, and still
  sends Cloudera Manager UTC bounds.
- Query Optimizer is a separate pasted-SQL parse/analyze workflow. It never
  executes SQL and does not echo submitted SQL after submit.
- Apache Impala upstream work around IMPALA-14953 is an explicit alignment
  point. Query Doctor should consume or compare against stable upstream profile
  JSON/parser/redactor contracts when they become available instead of
  duplicating the native one-profile AI analysis surface.
- Apache Impala aggregated / experimental profile-v2 work is an additional
  compatibility risk. Query Doctor should treat profile representation as a
  dialect, detect it before deterministic analysis, and fail closed when the
  dialect or required evidence sections are unknown or only partially mapped.
- Bounded Impala metadata collection is read-only, allowlisted, explicit, and
  redacted.
- Cloudera Manager metrics and events are runtime context. They can strengthen
  analyzer-supported hypotheses, but they are not standalone root-cause proof.
- Prometheus runtime metrics are optional context for configured direct Impala
  workflows. Prepared event/log sources remain future optional context.
- Synthetic Demo Mode is local-only and must not contact Cloudera Manager,
  Impala, Ollama, or the network.

## Product Direction

Query Doctor should be positioned and developed as a local-first Big Data query
diagnostic tool focused today on Impala production triage, not as an "AI
profile analyzer" button or an "AI SQL optimizer" whose primary promise is
automatic SQL rewriting.

- Keep Big Data SQL/lakehouse diagnostics as the long-term category, but make
  the current product promise Impala-first until another engine has implemented
  facts, fixtures, collection contracts, and safety tests.
- Treat upstream native Impala AI profile analysis as a reason to strengthen
  Query Doctor's cross-engine operator-workbench direction, not as permission to
  claim multi-engine support early.
- Start second-engine exploration when it helps shape the real engine fact
  contract, even before support-claim gates are complete. Keep that work
  fixture-driven, non-public, and unable to affect normal Impala workflows until
  it has safety coverage and diagnostic value.
- The primary product value is ranking suspicious Recent queries, explaining
  which evidence is supported, not observed, or unknown, and routing operators
  toward a safe inspection/change/verification loop.
- A trusted SQL draft is a useful outcome only when Python-owned facts,
  deterministic execution, and validation prove the rewrite boundary. It is not
  the flagship success metric.
- The main success metrics should be diagnosis coverage, primary-bottleneck
  coverage, evidence quality, reproducible workload impact, and action outcome
  learning.
- The LLM's durable role is report wording, recommendation wording, and
  engineering review support. It should not be treated as the trusted SQL writer
  for supported optimizer recipes or as the source of diagnostic facts.
- Marketing, demos, and benchmarks should lead with evidence-backed diagnosis:
  stats vs SQL shape vs runtime/admission/skew/data movement vs unknown, then
  show SQL rewrites only for recipe-backed cases.
- Upstream Impala profile-analysis work should become a compatibility target:
  profile JSON ingestion, parser coverage, redaction edge cases, and confidence
  labels are useful seams; duplicating the Impala Web UI native AI tab is not.
- Profile dialect and counter semantics are part of the trust contract. The
  analyzer should not assume that classic text, classic JSON, classic Thrift,
  and experimental profile-v2 expose equivalent sections, counter totals, or
  instance-level detail. Impala-provided counter significance/stability labels
  should improve future profile evidence quality when available, but they do
  not replace deterministic analyzer support.
- Product growth should deepen the current Impala wedge while preparing the
  engine fact contract that makes a future second engine real. Spark SQL is not
  a near-term direction: it would require a different runtime/profile fact
  model, collector surface, optimizer contract, and market positioning before
  Query Doctor has proven enough value on Impala workloads.

## Success Metrics

Primary diagnosis metrics:

- `case_primary_bottleneck` has medium-or-better confidence on at least 70% of
  representative real-case batches.
- `case_primary_bottleneck = unknown` is below 30% for normal Impala diagnosis
  work, and below roughly 20% before adding another SQL engine.
- Evidence quality improves over time through deterministic facts, metadata
  coverage, workload baselines, and action outcome history rather than through
  stronger wording.

Optimizer-specific metrics:

- `trusted_sql_draft_rate` is measured only on recipe-supported or
  draft-ready cases, not on all expensive candidates.
- On recipe-supported cases, trusted SQL draft production should be at least
  80% and `partial_untrusted_rate` should stay below 5%.
- A low `safe_to_attempt` rate on broad real Impala workloads is acceptable
  when no Python-owned recipe can prove the transform. It should be measured as
  recipe coverage, not as model failure.
- Broad Recent smoke runs should track optimizer funnel coverage with
  `scripts/audit_optimizer_funnel.py`, separating not-applicable, no-recipe,
  source-unavailable, safety-threshold, recipe-adjacent, and draft-ready cases
  before recipe yield is interpreted.

## Safety Baseline

The canonical safety contract lives in [safety-contract.md](safety-contract.md).
Roadmap work must not weaken that contract.

Planning summary:

- Python/analyzer owns facts; LLM owns wording only.
- Browser and trusted report output must stay raw-free.
- External collection stays explicit, bounded, read-only, redacted, and safe by
  default.
- Report and optimizer generation stays explicit and validation-gated.
- Profile-derived findings need a known profile dialect and an evidence tier
  before they can influence primary bottleneck classification or trusted report
  wording.

## Web UI And Deployment Direction

- Keep the web UI server-rendered by Python with small vanilla JavaScript
  helpers. A React, SPA, or other client-app migration is not a roadmap goal by
  itself because it expands the browser trust boundary and adds a build/runtime
  dependency that local-first users do not need.
- Treat a richer client application as future work only for a specific
  state-heavy surface, such as complex in-browser filtering, graph or timeline
  visualization, comparison workflows, or a richer optimizer editor. Such work
  must first define raw-free JSON/view-model contracts, preserve no-echo rules
  for pasted SQL, add browser-safety tests, and justify the dependency.
- Supported deployment is single-user local-first: the process runs under the
  user's own Cloudera Manager, Kerberos, Impala, Prometheus, and LLM context as
  configured, and stores artifacts locally. Shared network deployment is not
  supported by the current architecture.
- Non-local or shared deployment must remain an explicit "if you must" path
  until there is a real design partner. It needs corporate TLS/auth, trusted
  reverse-proxy boundaries, per-user job/artifact ownership, audit, persistence,
  and operational support before it becomes a product surface.
- Improve team usage through local-first patterns before building
  multi-tenancy: pinned versions, shared report repositories, CI-driven
  `query-doctor-batch-recent` runs, jumpboxes or remote devboxes, and shared
  internal LLM endpoints.
- Enterprise/commercial boundaries, if they are added later, should cover
  shared-deploy operations such as SSO, RBAC, artifact storage, audit export,
  centralized LLM quotas, Helm/reference deploy, and support. Safety,
  validation, diagnostic quality, and the single-user local workflow stay in
  core.
- Future-compatible web work must have immediate local-first value. Do not add
  speculative tenant scaffolding such as `actor`, `tenant_id`,
  `deployment_mode`, actor-scoped job-store APIs, or persistent shared stores
  until a concrete shared-deploy design exists. Prefer present-day safety
  boundaries that would also be correct later.

## Priority Bands

Use these bands when choosing work. The numbered Near-Term sections below stay
as domain backlogs; the priority band decides what should be pulled first when
items compete.

### P0 - Safety And Contracts

Do first when touched, because these items protect the trust boundary or unlock
multiple later changes:

- Product positioning contract: keep public docs and in-product help aligned on
  local-first Impala production triage, Recent Scan as the flagship workflow,
  Query ID as secondary, Query Optimizer as separate/read-only, and LLM wording
  downstream of Python-owned facts.
- Upstream alignment tracker: keep
  [upstream-impala-ai-analyzer.md](upstream-impala-ai-analyzer.md) current when
  IMPALA-14953 changes materially enough to affect Query Doctor scope.
- Browser and trusted-report safety: keep typed raw-free view models,
  presenter-owned display strings, consolidated trusted artifact loading,
  export of validated safe Markdown, and browser-safety tests for any new
  dynamic Details content.
- Local web hardening: package-owned static assets, tighter Content Security
  Policy, local POST origin/host checks, no-store/security headers, and bounded
  local job cleanup.
- Report and optimizer trust contracts: validator allowlists, trusted artifact
  predicates, marker validation, no-echo behavior, and strict
  recommendations-only or `no_rewrite` fallbacks.
- Provider-neutral analyzer contracts for the current Cloudera Manager path:
  canonical context keys/headings, legacy `cm_*` fallbacks, metrics reads by
  abstract `signal_id`, source provenance coverage wording, and legacy-safe
  compatibility.
- Profile dialect and evidence-tier contract: detect `classic_text_profile`,
  `classic_json_profile`, `classic_thrift_profile`,
  `experimental_profile_v2`, or `unknown` before profile-derived analysis;
  classify profile signals as `strong`, `medium`, `context_only`, or
  `unsupported`; map Impala-provided counter significance/stability labels into
  evidence quality when available; and prevent unknown or partially mapped
  dialects from driving primary bottleneck claims.

### P1 - Diagnostic Quality

Pull next, because these improve the core product value on current Impala and
Cloudera Manager deployments:

- Details evidence flow: deterministic findings first, concise evidence
  quality, limitations, runtime context, metadata status, and action routing.
- Runtime-context quality: collection coverage, observed and correlated
  signals, admission/pool context, host-tail diagnostics, and sanitized real
  fixtures.
- Direct Impala quality: sanitized real fixtures for fresh daemon profile
  layouts, Prometheus metric coverage, profile resource/timing action cards,
  and safe limitation wording when metrics, events, or metadata are unavailable.
- Profile dialect quality: add fixtures for classic text, classic JSON,
  classic Thrift, and experimental profile-v2 layouts; map only explicitly
  supported sections; and add regression tests that keep profile-v2 limitations
  visible without inventing missing instance-level evidence.
- Metadata and stats diagnosis: structured stats/query-shape facts, partition
  and join/filter column coverage, bottleneck calibration, and unknown-rate
  measurement on real batches.
- Workload-level diagnosis: raw-free fingerprint grouping, frequent-short
  workload triage, baseline/regression detection, and action outcome tracking.
- Upstream compatibility preparation: design a narrow profile JSON /
  parser/redactor compatibility plan and golden-profile quality harness before
  implementing any adapter.
- Multi-engine preparation: shape the engine fact contract from implemented
  Impala behavior so a later second engine can publish supported, not observed,
  and unknown facts without pretending every engine has Impala counters.
- Experimental second-engine discovery: choose one named analytical SQL engine
  from available artifacts or design-partner demand, then build a fixture-only
  parser/fact spike that exists to test the engine fact contract. It must not
  add public support claims, a runtime engine selector, or browser/report output
  before safety tests exist.
- Optimizer usefulness: fresh optimizer funnel measurement, expression-projection
  predicate pushdown, UNION ALL branch predicate pushdown, narrow Python-owned
  recipes for repeated expensive ETL shapes, and action-quality feedback.
- Diagnose and Recent results usability: keep the main page focused on which
  queries deserve attention, not on explaining every technical cause inline.
  The default result table should prioritize priority, short analyst-readable
  summary, duration, user/owner context, and a clear Details path. Table
  stats, metadata status, score reasons, result-group explanations, and other
  "why" evidence should move to Details or an explicit collapsed row/context
  disclosure unless they are needed to choose the next row to open.
- Web UI audit remains desktop-first. The next cleanup slices should keep
  reducing first-screen noise without hiding primary decisions: make the
  standalone Query Optimizer page feel less empty, continue simplifying Recent
  result rows, and re-audit Details, Running, Help, and Outcomes after each
  visible workflow change. Mobile polish is secondary until the desktop
  analyst flow is stable.

When choosing P1 product-growth work after required P0 contract work, target
these product areas first. The first workload-diagnostics slice has landed, so
the next product-growth work should stabilize it on real sanitized batches
before adding broader grouping dimensions.

1. Validate workload grouping, Frequent short, regressed workload labels,
   action queues, and outcome rollups on sanitized real batches.
2. Pool and admission diagnostics as analyzer-owned first-class causes.
3. Safe query-type grouping for Recent results, derived from deterministic
   facts rather than raw SQL.
4. Direct Impala daemon depth, fixtures, Prometheus coverage, and profile action
   cards.
5. Metadata and stats depth for join/filter column coverage, freshness,
   selectivity mismatch, and bottleneck calibration.

### P2 - Expansion Readiness

Do after P0 contracts are stable and P1 diagnostic quality is useful enough on
real Impala workloads:

- Thin source-family interfaces over real existing paths: `ProfileSource`,
  `QueryDiscoverySource`, `MetricsSource`, and `EventSource`.
- Direct Impala daemon source follow-up: add real fixture coverage, profile
  action cards, and a normalized engine fact contract before broadening beyond
  the current bounded Recent/Running/Known Query ID workflows.
- Profile JSON compatibility adapter only after a stable upstream contract,
  dialect detection, parser fixtures, redaction tests, evidence-tier mapping,
  and raw-free fact mapping exist.
- Prometheus-style metrics source follow-up: add sanitized real Ambari/Hadoop
  fixtures, strengthen direct Impala workflow coverage, and add additional
  allowlisted metric profiles only with tests.
- Engine profile-fact contract refactor before supporting any second SQL engine.
- Fixture-only second-engine spike may run in parallel with the engine
  fact-contract refactor when it is explicitly non-product behavior and cannot
  affect the default Impala workflow.
- Supported second-engine product path only after parser/fact fixtures,
  collection contracts, metadata allowlists, browser/report safety tests, and
  a documented support gap matrix exist.
- Storage/table-format facts only after provider and engine boundaries
  stabilize.

### Deferred - Not Current Support

Keep these out of implementation plans until their explicit readiness signal is
met: shared deployment, multi-tenancy, public second-engine support, plugin
framework, generic SQL execution, broad package reorganization, and fake
adapters.

## Impala Implemented-Signal Backlog

These are roadmap items from already-visible Impala or adjacent Cloudera
diagnostic surfaces. They are not current Query Doctor behavior unless the
status says an analyzer baseline already exists.

| Item | Priority | Why it matters | Safety rule | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Profile counter stability and versioned aliases | P0 | Impala counter significance labels and versioned counter names can reduce name-based guesswork. | Stability and aliases are eligibility only; deterministic interpretation, thresholds, query-specific support, and raw-free summaries are still required. | Bundled registry exists for client-fetch and spill/scratch counters; optional direct `/profile_docs` probing can write a safe allowlisted context for interpreted counters. Broader aliases and registry refresh tooling remain future work. |
| Profile input dialect and Web UI JSON export | P0 | The Impala Web UI can export profiles as text, Thrift, or Json; JSON may become a less fragile ingestion path than text parsing when fixtures prove it. | Unknown, partial, or experimental dialects fail closed for primary bottleneck claims; no raw profile rendering. | Dialect detection, limited classic JSON mapped-counter ingestion, and opt-in direct JSON endpoint probing with text fallback exist; fuller JSON/Thrift/profile-v2 mapping remains future work. |
| Admission context collector | P1 | `/admission?json` exposes pool queue/running context and pool stats that can explain workload pressure around a selected query. | Collect only bounded aggregate facts such as queue present, queue-time bucket, pressure, and freshness; never expose raw queued/running lists or promote admission without query-specific wait/result evidence. | Future; selected-query admission facts already gate current `runtime_admission` promotion. |
| Storage-aware scan diagnostics | P1 | HDFS locality, remote HDFS, S3, ADLS/ABFS, Ozone, and remote-read data cache have different scan semantics. | Derive a safe `storage_context`; do not expose paths, object URIs, credentials, hosts, or treat object-store remote reads as HDFS locality failures. | Future; current docs keep mixed cache/remote I/O as a caveat. |
| Resource-trace CPU/I/O facts | P1 | `RESOURCE_TRACE_RATIO` can add Per Node Profiles metrics for CPU usage, I/O wait, disk throughput, and network throughput when enabled. | Treat absence as unknown; host-wide throughput is context-only unless mapped to selected-query evidence, and raw per-node or host rows must not reach UI/reports. | Future; current profile timing/resource facts do not parse resource traces. |
| Runtime filter diagnostics | P1 | EXPLAIN and PROFILE can expose runtime filter producer/consumer and routing details. | Do not claim missing or late runtime filters as a root cause without deterministic producer, consumer, target scan, timing, and spill-context evidence. | Future; current docs only record runtime-filter limitations. |
| Skew detection refinement | P1 | Stronger skew findings should prefer multi-host, long-running phases with Max Time vs Avg Time imbalance and corroborating bytes, memory, or network spread. | Avoid timing-ratio-only findings and keep aggregate-only skew context below primary-bottleneck promotion. | Partially implemented for scan-skew; additional exchange/execution skew hardening remains. |
| Statistics UNKNOWN normalization | P1 | Impala uses placeholders such as `-1` for unavailable table or column stats. | Normalize placeholders to `unknown` or `missing`; trusted reports must not present placeholder values as literal business facts. | Current stats quality exists; keep this as a regression rule for metadata parser and report work. |
| Observability health-check parity matrix | P2 / research | Cloudera Observability health checks are a useful benchmark for missing/corrupt stats, spilling, slow scan/hash join/planning/materialization/sorting, and skew categories. | Do not copy health-check wording blindly; map each category to Query Doctor support status, deterministic evidence required, safe report wording, and unsupported/unknown gaps. | Future research/backlog matrix. |
| Built-in Impala AI analyzer watchlist | P2 / research | Upstream native Impala AI profile-analysis work shifts Query Doctor away from a one-profile AI button. | Keep positioning around local-first Recent triage, Cloudera Manager integration, bounded metadata/context, deterministic analyzer facts, validation, and raw-free reports. | Existing upstream tracker; keep current when IMPALA-14953 changes materially. |

## Next Pull Queue

This is the short ordered queue for the next roadmap pulls. Pull a different
item first only when the touched area has a direct P0 safety or contract risk.

1. Continue the profile evidence-tier contract before broadening upstream
   profile compatibility: the dialect detector is in place, so the next pulls
   should add the remaining promotion-specific fixtures that prove
   exchange-wait and disk-I/O claims require the right supporting sections. The
   client-fetch-tail, runtime-admission, memory-pressure, and scan-skew
   evidence slices are implemented and should now be validated against
   sanitized real profiles.
2. Continue the desktop Web UI audit with the standalone Query Optimizer page:
   tighten the first screen around the SQL input, Analyze action, and
   scope/safety disclosure without weakening the no-echo or read-only trust
   boundary.
3. Keep the IMPALA-14953 upstream tracker current and turn stable upstream
   profile JSON/parser/redactor signals into a narrow compatibility plan before
   coding an adapter.
4. Define the first engine fact-contract slice and a fixture-only second-engine
   discovery spike, starting from
   [trino-discovery-spike.md](trino-discovery-spike.md), that can validate the
   contract without changing current Impala support or public claims.
5. Finish the Diagnose results-table simplification pass: reduce the default
   Recent results table to "which queries are bad and worth opening", move
   technical status/context such as stats, metadata, table key, score reasons,
   and group explanations behind Details or explicit disclosures, and then run
   a short repeat UI audit against the local web page.
6. Finish the remaining provider-neutral runtime contract tail: report-validator
   heading tests when aliases or headings change, plus compatibility-safe
   UI/presenter naming cleanup.
7. Use source provenance for safe Details/report coverage and limitation
   wording, including explicit direct Impala coverage for profile, optional
   Prometheus metrics, unavailable events, and metadata status.
8. Stabilize the new workload-diagnostics surfaces on sanitized real batches:
   repeated/frequent-short/regressed groups, admin digest, action queue,
   workload detail pages, and action outcome rollups.
9. Use `scripts/audit_optimizer_funnel.py` on the latest broad Recent smoke to
   choose the next optimizer slice from repeated workload groups and no-recipe
   shape families. Start with the largest repeated family where analyzer facts
   and validation can prove a safe Python-owned transform; otherwise keep the
   result as review guidance rather than a trusted SQL draft.
10. Continue replacing report-side stats/query-shape extraction with structured
   analyzer facts and validate the result on real sanitized batches.
11. Add safe query-type grouping only after deterministic classifier facts can
   explain unknown or unsupported shapes without reading raw SQL.

## Dependency And Readiness Rules

Use these rules to keep roadmap work ordered. They override local convenience
when a tempting implementation would skip a contract boundary.

- Provider decoupling order is fixed: canonical context keys/headings,
  report-validator snapshots, metrics by `signal_id`, per-case provenance,
  and thin source-family interfaces over the current Cloudera Manager, direct
  Impala, and Prometheus paths before broader provider expansion.
- P2 provider work must not start until the P0 provider-neutral contracts it
  depends on are in place. Do not add placeholder provider packages; expand
  provider boundaries only from implemented Cloudera Manager, direct Impala, and
  Prometheus paths.
- Profile-derived classification order is fixed: detect dialect, map supported
  sections, assign evidence tiers, then classify. Unknown profiles must not
  produce primary bottleneck classification. Experimental profile-v2 sections
  may produce only limited findings until each section has explicit mapping,
  fixtures, and safety tests. Scan-skew and backend-tail claims require
  per-instance or equivalent aggregate evidence, not just operator totals.
- Second-engine exploration and second-engine support are different gates.
  Exploration may start earlier when it is fixture-only, scoped to shaping the
  engine fact contract, does not add a public support claim, does not add fake
  adapters, and cannot affect default Impala workflows.
- A supported second SQL engine must wait until all of these are true:
  `case_primary_bottleneck = unknown` is below roughly 20% on a representative
  100+ case real Impala batch or there is a design-partner workload that proves
  cross-engine urgency, workload fingerprinting and baselines work on real data,
  action outcome tracking has applied/not-applied records, direct Impala
  diagnosis is stable on non-Cloudera-Manager deployments, a real design
  partner or real artifact set identifies a specific second engine, and an
  engine profile-fact contract already exists from implemented behavior.
- Shared deployment work must wait for an explicit shared-deploy product
  decision, a real design partner, and a design for authentication, ownership,
  audit, persistence, and operational support.
- Keep P0 narrow. An item belongs in P0 only when it protects browser/report
  safety, validation/trust contracts, no-echo/raw-free behavior, or a schema
  boundary that unlocks several later changes. Product-quality improvements
  without that contract effect belong in P1.

## Near-Term Priorities

### 1. Local Web Hardening And Team Workflow

Make the local web UI easier to maintain and safer to operate without turning
it into a shared service.

- Extract CSS and JavaScript from `query_doctor/web/ui/layout.py` into
  package-owned static assets served by the local web server with explicit
  content types. Preserve the early theme/design bootstrap behavior and keep
  browser-safety rendering tests around the change.
- Tighten Content Security Policy after static assets land by removing
  `'unsafe-inline'` from script/style policy where practical. Keep existing
  no-store caching, local Host allowlist, and security headers current; add
  missing low-cost headers such as `Permissions-Policy` when useful.
- Add a lightweight POST origin/host check for local web requests. Treat full
  CSRF token machinery as deferred until a non-local or shared deployment path
  is explicitly designed.
- Keep supported deployment guidance current in README and SECURITY guidance:
  single-user, local-first, behind the user's own configured credentials and
  local access. Call out that binding the current server as a shared corporate
  service is not supported.
- Document team usage patterns before building multi-tenancy: shared reports
  repository, CI scheduled batch scans, shared internal LLM endpoint, team
  jumpbox or remote devbox, and version pinning.
- Add a browser action to export a validated report as safe Markdown for Jira,
  Confluence, or a shared reports repository. It must only expose trusted
  report content and must not reveal local paths, raw artifact filenames, raw
  SQL, profiles, metadata, or subprocess output.
- Verify and document case deep links such as `/batch/case/<id>` for users who
  open the same `batch_summary.json`; keep request paths unable to choose local
  files.
- Add bounded TTL cleanup for the in-memory web job store as local reliability
  work. Do not turn it into a multi-user ACL or persistence project without an
  explicit shared-deploy decision.
- Keep browser rendering on typed raw-free view models. New Details blocks
  should accept presenter-owned dataclasses with safe primitive fields or
  `SafeHtml`, rather than raw case/facts dictionaries.
- Keep trusted artifact access behind `query_doctor.web.trusted_artifacts`.
  Validated reports and optimizer outcomes should reach UI code only after
  marker checks, path safety checks, and display redaction in that boundary.
- Add lightweight request/job trace IDs for correlating local web logs,
  background jobs, and subprocess outcomes. Do not add actor or deployment-mode
  fields until an actual identity source is selected.

### 2. Details Usability And Evidence Flow

Make Details efficient for Recent queries, Running now, and Known Query ID
workflows.

- Keep the visible page question-oriented: why this query deserves attention,
  where to inspect it, what supported change direction to try, and how to
  verify the change.
- Keep deterministic findings first, but phrase them as decision support rather
  than as a dump of collector-source facts.
- Make evidence quality, runtime context, Cloudera Manager metrics, Cloudera
  Manager events, metadata status, and limitations easy to scan.
- Remove duplicated or low-value blocks when they make the page harder to use.
- Keep pipeline status, profile sections, metric-provider details, and broad
  fact tables in collapsed Diagnostics unless they directly support the
  verdict, recommendation, verification step, or an explicit limitation.
- Keep all dynamic browser text behind presenter/display safety helpers.
- Do not render raw artifacts or arbitrary docs in the browser.
- Post-release Details audit follow-ups: align the Recent Results `Finding`
  wording with Details verdict wording, replace vague score-summary copy such
  as "positive score from detailed analyzer reasons" with a signal-class
  summary, and evaluate whether local `batch_summary.json` still needs to store
  `case_dir` or can move to a narrower server-owned case reference without
  disrupting Details, report, or optimizer routes.

### 3. Runtime Context Quality

Improve how runtime context supports diagnosis without overclaiming.

- Show collection status, coverage, observed signals, correlated signals,
  context-only signals, and limitations.
- Keep Details verdict and diagnostic facts current so Details separate strong
  analyzer-backed findings, plausible follow-up checks, context-only runtime
  signals, unknown evidence, metadata coverage, and stats evidence without
  duplicating the same triage cards in multiple visible blocks.
- Keep Cloudera Manager metrics and events as normalized analyzer facts.
- Treat duration and runtime context as supporting evidence unless direct facts
  support a stronger claim.
- Add more sanitized fixtures for long-running writer, scan, exchange,
  join-heavy, metrics, and events cases.
- Add fingerprint and workload baseline comparisons so the analyzer can
  distinguish chronic bad queries from regressions without exposing raw SQL.
- Improve profile-to-plan mapping across fragments, operators, tables, joins,
  exchanges, and write paths so findings point to the supported execution
  location instead of a generic symptom.
- Improve metadata/stats quality facts for stale or missing table stats, column
  stats on join/filter columns, partition coverage, selectivity mismatch, and
  real-fixture validation for stats-present-but-not-explanatory cases.

Current workload-level diagnostics baseline and follow-ups:

- Current-scan workload groups are implemented with `schema_version: 1`, safe
  `wf_` fingerprints, raw-free aggregate fields, result groups for repeated,
  frequent-short, and regressed workload fingerprints, plus workload detail
  pages, admin pool/owner digest, analyst action queue, and action outcome
  rollups.
- Frequent short is now a scan preset and result group. It removes the
  minimum-duration default for that preset and ranks repeated fingerprints by
  current-scan impact, while keeping bounded scan caps and raw-free
  limitations visible.
- Local workload history and action outcomes remain local, raw-free, and
  explicit. Do not expose local history paths, raw SQL, raw profiles, raw
  metadata, optimizer source SQL, column lists, predicates, literals, aliases,
  comments, host/daemon identifiers, raw artifact names, or free-form analyzer
  wording.
- Follow-up work is to validate group ranking and limitations on sanitized real
  batches, improve baseline/regression calibration, add safe query-type
  grouping (#67) from deterministic classifier facts, and add stable
  demo/operator notes for synthetic scenarios (#47).
- Keep LLM group summaries out until deterministic group facts and
  browser-safe validation boundaries exist.

Current pool/admission baseline and follow-ups:

- Keep the existing `runtime_admission` `case_primary_bottleneck` label rather
  than adding a parallel admission label. Promote it only when analyzer-owned
  query-specific facts support admission wait or admission result evidence,
  such as direct profile counters, profile timeline facts, or Cloudera Manager
  query attributes.
- Keep pool/admission actions deterministic and non-LLM by default: rebalance a
  query class, review pool sizing, or collect a bounded workload window before
  claiming SQL-shape or stats work is the next action.
- Do not infer admission pressure from duration alone. Cluster pool saturation,
  runtime metrics, events, concurrent workload signals, and Prometheus gauges
  remain supporting context unless query-specific analyzer facts prove the
  bottleneck. A stats or SQL-shape finding may still coexist with
  `runtime_admission` and must not be suppressed.

Provider-neutral runtime context cleanup:

- Treat source identity as data, not analyzer schema. Canonical
  `Runtime Metrics Facts`, `Runtime Metrics Correlation`, and
  `Cluster Runtime Context` headings are the current analyzer/report contract;
  keep legacy `CM Metrics` heading load fallbacks for old artifacts. Analyzer
  runtime readers now use canonical `query_context`, `metrics_context`,
  `metrics_facts`, and `metrics_correlation` keys with `cm_*` fallbacks.
  Report contract digests also expose `metrics_facts` and
  `metrics_correlation` aliases while preserving legacy digest keys. Runtime
  metric collectors now write abstract catalog `signal_id`s next to
  provider-specific `id`s, and analyzer metric facts read via `signal_id` with
  legacy ID fallbacks. Source Provenance uses explicit Cloudera Manager and
  Prometheus labels for collected runtime metrics and generic `Runtime metrics`
  wording when metrics are absent or unknown. Report guardrails read
  provider-neutral Runtime Metrics Correlation headings when checking
  context-only signals. Web Details facts loaders expose provider-neutral
  runtime-metrics aliases and state builders consume them, while preserving
  existing `cm_*` keys, wrapper names, and artifacts as legacy load fallbacks.
  The remaining migration is broader source-provenance use in safe
  Details/report coverage wording and compatibility-safe UI/presenter naming
  cleanup.
- Keep report-validator heading allowlists and snapshot tests in sync with any
  heading or alias change, so the trusted report contract cannot drift silently.
- Keep any later metric-catalog expansion source-backed: new metrics must write
  a catalog `signal_id` plus a provider-specific `id`, and analyzer reads must
  preserve legacy fallback for old corpora.
- Use analyzer source provenance for raw-free UI/report coverage wording and
  explicit `none`, `unavailable`, or partial-coverage limitations. Keep any
  later persistence or snapshot contract changes narrow and compatibility-safe.
- Introduce source-family interfaces only when they wrap real current paths:
  `ProfileSource`, `QueryDiscoverySource`, `MetricsSource`, and `EventSource`,
  with Cloudera Manager wrappers over existing helpers. Avoid one broad
  provider object, fake implementations, or placeholder packages.

Profile dialect and counter evidence acceptance details:

Implemented baseline:

- profile dialect detection and primary-bottleneck policy are in place;
- incomplete/cancelled exec-node guardrails are in place for mapped profile
  signals;
- client-fetch-tail facts and primary routing are in place for mapped
  `ClientFetchWait*` counters, with Query Timeline fetch and
  `GetInFlightProfileTimeStats` kept as context unless corroborated;
- runtime-admission facts and primary routing are evidence-tiered: selected
  query admission result/wait and profile/query-timeline admission facts can
  promote `runtime_admission`, materially conflicting waits stay context-only,
  and pool, cluster, metric, event, or duration-only signals cannot promote it.
- memory-pressure facts are evidence-tiered: selected-query non-zero
  spill/scratch counters are the current strong evidence path, while memory
  estimates, reservations, peak-memory footprints, daemon metrics, and runtime
  context remain context-only.
- scan-skew facts are evidence-tiered: per-instance scan bytes, bytes-read,
  rows, or mapped equivalent spread are the current strong evidence path, while
  backend data-skew summaries without those mapped fields remain context-only.

Next P0 analyzer slices:

1. Harden exchange-wait and disk-I/O promotion:
   - exchange/network/inactive timers need mapped exchange context and
     correlation before exceeding medium evidence;
   - disk I/O wait needs bytes and operator context before promotion.

1. Dialect detection:
   - classify profiles as `classic_text_profile`, `classic_json_profile`,
     `classic_thrift_profile`, `experimental_profile_v2`, or `unknown` before
     profile-derived analyzer work begins;
   - emit a safe limitation for unknown or partially mapped dialects;
   - keep raw profile payload, local paths, hostnames, users, and artifact names
     out of browser-visible text and trusted reports.
2. Evidence tiers:
   - `strong`: query-specific profile evidence from a mapped dialect section,
     with required corroborating fields for that finding family;
   - `medium`: query-specific evidence that is mapped but missing one
     corroborating dimension, suitable for follow-up direction but not a root
     cause claim;
   - `context_only`: runtime, estimate, or aggregate context that can support a
     recommendation only when stronger analyzer facts exist;
   - `unsupported`: missing, unknown, or unmapped evidence that must not
     influence primary bottleneck classification.
3. Bottleneck promotion rules:
   - admission wait is strong only from query timeline, admission wait, or
     admission result facts for the selected query;
   - memory pressure is strong with explicit non-zero spill or scratch counters,
     while estimates and reservations alone stay context-only;
   - baseline implemented: scan skew is strong only with per-instance scan
     bytes, bytes-read, rows, or a mapped equivalent spread section;
   - exchange wait, network, and inactive timers require correlation before they
     can exceed medium evidence;
   - disk I/O wait requires bytes and operator context before promotion;
   - baseline implemented: mapped `ClientFetchWait*` counters can strongly
     support a client-fetch-tail finding only when they are a large share of
     selected-query duration; primary bottleneck routing requires that finding
     to be the top elapsed runtime finding. They are not a Hue, network, BI
     tool, or client root-cause claim by themselves.
4. Incomplete/cancelled node guardrail:
   - baseline implemented: mapped profile-wide and per-node incomplete or
     cancelled signals now emit raw-free Exec Node Completeness facts and block
     affected row/cardinality promotion;
   - detect mapped profile signals that an exec node may be incomplete,
     closed-early, or cancelled;
   - downgrade cardinality, row-count, scan-selectivity, and
     runtime-filter-effectiveness conclusions for affected nodes;
   - never infer an empty table, meaningful zero-row selectivity, or runtime
     filters filtering everything from incomplete node evidence.
5. Runtime filter and storage limitations:
   - treat HDFS runtime-filter counters as interpretable only when the scan
     section and node-completion state are mapped;
   - keep Kudu runtime-filter effectiveness `unknown` or `unsupported` until a
     Kudu-specific counter contract and fixtures exist;
   - downgrade raw throughput interpretation for mixed data-cache and
     remote/object-store I/O, and do not claim remote storage slowness without
     source-specific evidence.
6. Heuristic-only backlog:
   - keep exchange-partition skew as heuristic-only until receiver distribution
     counters or equivalent aggregate evidence exists;
   - treat `GetInFlightProfileTimeStats`, huge profiles, and high `mt_dop`
     profile overhead as profile-serialization context, not client-fetch root
     cause proof;
   - keep planner mode / Calcite estimate-drift awareness as P2 context until
     mapped fixtures can compare plan mode, estimates, and runtime rows.

Workload stabilization acceptance details:

1. Real-batch workload validation:
   - compare repeated, frequent-short, and regressed grouping against sanitized
     real batches;
   - record false positives and false negatives in raw-free terms;
   - keep singleton or noisy groups out of the primary table unless there is a
     regression, status, spill, stats, or runtime signal.
2. Safe query-type grouping:
   - derive type labels from deterministic classifier facts only;
   - keep unknown or unsupported types explicit;
   - do not leak raw SQL, identifiers, predicates, or literals.
3. Action outcome learning:
   - keep recorded/applied/outcome labels whitelisted and local;
   - use outcomes to validate recommendation families rather than to inflate
     confidence.

### 4. Query Optimizer Usefulness

Keep optimizer trust strict while making useful outcomes more common.

- Keep expensive production queries as the primary optimizer target. Do not
  optimize for easy low-value rewrites just because they are easier to draft.
  The product value comes from diagnosing and improving costly workload shapes.
- Treat trusted SQL drafts as one optimizer outcome, not the only successful
  outcome for expensive queries. A useful optimizer result may be a validated
  SQL rewrite, a stats action, a query-shape recommendation, a data/layout
  recommendation, or a clear "needs deeper facts" limitation.
- Separate "expensive" from "rewriteable": duration, exchange volume, scan
  volume, skew, and cardinality anomalies identify potential value, but they do
  not prove a safe automatic SQL rewrite exists.
- Add a rewriteability taxonomy alongside optimization score: expensive query,
  likely stats problem, likely query-shape problem, currently Python-draftable,
  promising new recipe family, and human-review-only.
- Do not use random production-query hunting as the main demo strategy. A
  credible demo should use a reproducible expensive workload shape with
  analyzer evidence, deterministic recipe coverage, and production evidence
  that the shape occurs.
- Develop optimizer work as facts-first recipes: analyzer-owned facts should
  first prove predicate origin, projection mapping, CTE boundaries,
  stats-vs-query context, and competing bottlenecks; only then should a narrow
  Python-owned recipe produce a trusted SQL draft.
- Treat Optimization Candidate as a funnel, not a promise of SQL rewrite:
  candidate detected, rewrite recipe detected, SQL draft safe to attempt,
  trusted SQL draft produced.
- Make user-visible optimizer states explain why a SQL draft was not produced:
  no deterministic recipe, SQL shape over safety thresholds, CTE body validation
  not proven, set-operation boundary, no material change, or trusted
  recommendations-only.
- Recent real-case batch testing showed that stats-available optimization
  candidates can still produce zero trusted SQL drafts. The bottleneck was not
  validation failure or missing table stats; it was insufficient Python-owned
  proof for a safe rewrite, high-risk SQL shape, or no material LLM change.
- A 1,000-case Recent smoke audit showed that the largest current optimizer
  gap is no-recipe coverage rather than the old `not_candidate` bucket. After
  recomputation with current rewrite-support classification, broad cases split
  roughly into `not_candidate` 496, `guidance_only` 492,
  `source_unavailable` 11, and `draft_disabled` 1. The no-recipe layer was
  dominated by plain SQL workload groups, not by current CTE/derived
  predicate-pushdown surfaces.
- Add anonymized real fixtures for long `WITH`, CTE-heavy,
  join/filter/projection-preservation, and model-discipline failure cases.
- Add Python-owned recipes only where analyzer facts and validation can prove
  the boundary; avoid prompt-only rewrite freedom when the analyzer cannot
  explain the transformation.
- Add CTE simplification recipes as separate proven transforms: inline only
  single-use CTEs, remove pass-through CTE layers, use expanded CTE trees for
  internal analysis when helpful, and treat multi-use CTE inlining as a
  recommendations-only materialization or pre-aggregation hint unless Python
  can prove duplication is safe and useful.
- Prefer trusted `no_rewrite` or recommendations-only outcomes over
  speculative SQL drafts.
- Use `scripts/compare_optimizer_models.py --fixture-corpus` before changing
  prompt strategy or model defaults.
- Recognize the current strategic limit: LLM-as-SQL-writer is not reliable for
  expensive production queries under strict validation. Use the LLM primarily
  for wording, review, and candidate recipe design unless Python-owned facts and
  validation already define the rewrite boundary.
- For recipe-supported cases, Python should produce the trusted SQL draft.
  Calling the LLM as a second SQL writer on that path should be treated as
  latency/cost and bug surface unless it is explicitly limited to wording or
  human-readable explanation.
- Current external review diagnosis: the bottleneck is Python-rule coverage and
  candidate selection, not model quality, prompts, the validator, or table
  stats. Real cases are selected for cost, while supported recipes still assume
  textbook projection, predicate, qualifier, and CTE/UNION shapes.
- The shared predicate-pushdown helper contract is now a completed baseline for
  existing predicate-pushdown recipes: top-level and whole-group parenthesized
  `AND` conjuncts are evaluated independently, safe conjuncts can be copied
  without copying unsafe siblings, and tests cover mixed aliases, joins,
  `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `IS NULL`, grouped CTEs, derived tables, existing inner
  `WHERE` append, and no-copy cases. Keep hardening this contract when new
  predicate forms are admitted, but do not treat it as a new recipe family.
- Keep the validator strict. Improving SQL draft yield should come from richer
  analyzer facts, per-shape deterministic executors, and recipe-aware selection,
  not from loosening validation.

The completed optimizer recipe baseline is tracked in
[changelog.md](changelog.md). This roadmap lists remaining direction, not
completed implementation inventory.

Remaining near-term optimizer work:

1. Run `scripts/audit_optimizer_funnel.py` on the latest broad Recent smoke and
   use repeated workload groups plus no-recipe shape-family counts as the
   recipe-candidate backlog. The first target should be the largest repeated
   family where analyzer facts and validation can prove a safe transform.
2. Re-run the real optimizer benchmark after the prompt-route split, model
   default split, rewriteability taxonomy, recipe-aware ranking, and
   per-conjunct predicate-pushdown baseline. Compare trusted SQL drafts,
   deterministic no-recipe outcomes, recommendations-only outcomes, and
   validation failures before adding another recipe.
3. Target new recipes at expensive ETL patterns rather than low-value small
   queries: partition-limited `INSERT OVERWRITE ... anti-join staging UNION ALL
   staging`, large-fact joins to small distinct key sets, wider post-UNION
   rollups, pre-aggregation before exchange, and repeated-scan / redundant CTE
   shapes.
4. Add narrow expression-projection predicate pushdown. The first version
   should allow only deterministic scalar projection expressions with no
   aggregate/window/subquery inputs and should substitute output aliases back to
   exact source expressions under validation.
5. Extend UNION ALL branch predicate pushdown after branch lineage facts can
   prove which branch owns the filtered output column. Validation must preserve
   branch count/order/schema and keep untouched branches byte-equivalent.
6. Treat `pre_aggregate_join_input` as a larger follow-up project, not the next
   quick recipe: additive measure proof, join-key/group-key containment, outer
   joins, `AVG`, and `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` make this high value but high risk.
7. Turn any repeated successful generic rewrite into an analyzer-owned fact plus
   Python-owned recipe only when validation can prove the boundary.
8. Validate the expanded CTE facts against sanitized real fixtures and add only
   missing analyzer-owned categories that block proof of specific future
   recipes.
9. Add more focused deterministic recipes for CTE simplification only after
   recipe-specific validation exists, especially single-use CTE inlining and
   wider pass-through variants with aliases or downstream CTE consumers.
10. Validate analyzer-owned stats-evidence facts with real sanitized fixtures,
   especially stats-present-but-not-primary cases and mixed stats/runtime
   bottleneck signals.
11. Use repeated real-case batches to measure the full optimizer funnel after
   each facts or recipe change: optimization candidate, stats/query context,
   recipe detected, safe to attempt, trusted draft, and no-draft reason.
12. Automate the optimizer funnel against fixture and sanitized real corpora
   outside the normal fast CI path. Each run should produce a raw-free
   `funnel.json` with candidate, recipe-detected, draft-ready, trusted-draft,
   no-rewrite, recommendations-only, and failure counts, and alert on material
   regressions.
13. Keep LLM prompts constrained to applying analyzer-proven rewrite tasks with
   minimal diffs.

Stop condition for the trusted SQL-draft direction:

- After expression-projection pushdown and UNION ALL branch pushdown are
  implemented and tested, a fresh 200+ case medium/high batch still has a
  `safe_to_attempt` rate below roughly 5%.
- Recipe-adjacent backlog is not materially larger than safe-draft cases,
  meaning real workloads are structurally outside the conservative recipe
  surface rather than merely under-implemented.
- `deterministic_draft_unavailable` does not drop materially after the new
  facts/recipes, with unsupported reasons still dominated by aggregate,
  window, join, or set-operation boundaries the product should not cross.
- Blind review or re-collection cannot show a meaningful difference between
  trusted drafts and originals.

If these hold, the optimizer should retreat from trusted SQL draft production
as a central product promise and focus on evidence-backed recommendations,
stats/query-shape classification, and a DBA-facing recipe feasibility funnel.

### 5. Metadata Selection Policy

Make default metadata collection policy explicit and bounded.

- Treat stats/metadata diagnosis as a first-class optimizer routing input, not
  just report context. Expensive cases should be separated into stats-primary,
  SQL-shape-primary, runtime-primary, mixed, and unknown before choosing a SQL
  rewrite, stats action, or runtime follow-up path.
- Prefer structured analyzer facts over rendered `analysis_facts.md` wording in
  scoring. Markdown text remains a compatibility fallback, not the source of
  truth for stats/query-shape classification.
- Do not claim stale stats without direct structured evidence. Until freshness
  or partition-divergence facts exist, "stats present but estimates still wrong"
  should be phrased as an unknown or non-primary stats signal, not as staleness.
- Prioritize high-severity analyzed cases.
- Include top medium/high Optimization candidates and suspicious cases where
  cardinality, memory, stats, or query-shape candidates need metadata to avoid
  misleading conclusions.
- Avoid default metadata collection for clean/short queries, admin statements,
  failed/cancelled cases without useful execution evidence, and cases that
  exceed bounds.
- Show `not_requested`, `partial`, `failed`, and `insufficient_metadata` as
  distinct user-facing states.

Near-term metadata/stats work:

1. Finish replacing report-side stats/query-shape extractors with structured
   analyzer facts where available. Recent stats and query optimization scorers
   already prefer `analysis.json` and keep rendered markdown parsing only as a
   fallback.
2. Continue treating stats freshness as unknown unless a future direct
   staleness or metadata-divergence fact exists. Recent scoring no longer uses
   `stats_possibly_stale` rendered text as positive evidence.
3. Continue calibrating `case_primary_bottleneck` presentation. Recent batch
   summaries and Details pages already include safe label, confidence and
   reason-category presentation when `analysis.json` is available.
4. Continue calibrating high-confidence `case_primary_bottleneck` caps.
   Non-primary stats/query action candidate tiers are already capped to `low`
   for high-confidence primary bottlenecks.
5. Use the batch-level `case_primary_bottleneck_distribution` in
   `batch_summary.json`/Markdown to track unknown, mixed, not-classified, and
   medium-or-better confidence rates across real-case batches.
6. Improve partition and column stats detail from already-collected metadata:
   partition row-count coverage counts are now parsed from `SHOW TABLE STATS`;
   remaining work is join/filter column stats coverage, without exposing raw
   partition values or raw metadata output.

Stop condition for stats diagnosis without EXPLAIN or reruns:

- After structured scoring, stale-signal gating, `case_primary_bottleneck`,
  partition coverage counts, and join/filter column stats coverage land,
  `case_primary_bottleneck = unknown` remains above roughly 30% on a sanitized
  100+ real-case batch.
- Mixed stats and SQL-shape/runtime rate remains above roughly 40%, meaning the
  analyzer cannot order likely causes from direct profile and bounded metadata
  facts alone.
- Blind reviewer agreement with `case_primary_bottleneck` is no better than
  chance on a held-out reviewer-labelled set of at least 30 cases.
- Re-collection after a user-applied stats action does not materially change
  cardinality anomalies, top estimated-row gaps, or
  `stats_metadata_quality.stats_primary_bottleneck`.

If two or more of these hold, stats diagnosis should retreat to follow-up-check
wording: no high-confidence stats primary label and no high-tier stats action
without EXPLAIN, rerun, or stronger direct metadata evidence.

### 6. Agent-Friendly Documentation

Keep active docs short enough to be read before implementation.

- `docs/codex-handoff.md`: current engineering baseline.
- `docs/code-audit.md`: active risks only.
- `docs/query-optimizer-contract.md`: optimizer trust contract.
- `docs/architecture.md`: current boundaries plus future seams.
- `docs/roadmap.md`: this active plan.
- `docs/changelog.md`: significant behavior, safety, workflow, and baseline
  changes only.
- `docs/README.md`: document status index. Every listed document should be
  marked `active` or `reference`.
- `docs/agent-playbook.md`: change-type routing for required reading, focused
  tests, and documentation updates.

Historical planning detail should stay out of active docs unless it changes a
current decision.

Documentation cleanup priorities:

1. Remove historical release, collector, audit, and prototype notes from the
   current tree unless they remain useful as explicitly listed `reference`
   documents in `docs/README.md`.
2. Keep `docs/code-audit.md` and `docs/analyzer-audit.md` as the only active
   audit files. Older audit snapshots should stay out of the current tree
   unless they are explicitly listed reference documents.
3. Keep `docs/safety-contract.md` as the canonical safety document. Security
   overview and roadmap safety sections should link to it instead of redefining
   the contract.
4. Keep `docs/changelog.md` as completed-work history. Do not add completed
   implementation inventories to the roadmap; when a roadmap item is closed,
   move the significant result to the changelog.

## Medium-Term Work

- Evidence Quality Score expansion: reuse analyzer-owned confidence in reports
  and add more structured limitations for incomplete metadata/runtime evidence.
- Host Tail Diagnostics: correlate profile backend-tail evidence with bounded
  host/daemon metrics and repeated-host patterns.
- Admission And Pool Context: add safe facts for queue wait, pool saturation,
  concurrent load, and admission pressure.
- Action Catalog: map deterministic recommendation types to local runbooks,
  owner hints, and expected validation signals.
- Evidence-grade reporting: classify report confidence as bronze, silver, or
  gold based on deterministic facts coverage, metadata coverage, workload
  baseline availability, and action outcome history.
- Safer local job history/status persistence for UI sessions.
- Focused package splits where feature work touches mixed responsibilities.

## Deferred

These are not current support. Revisit them only when the listed signal is met.

### Shared Deploy And Enterprise

- Multi-tenant web service, OIDC/SAML auth, RBAC, identity-bound job store,
  shared artifact storage, centralized audit export, centralized LLM quota and
  cost attribution, WSGI/gunicorn/waitress runtime, and Helm/k8s deployment are
  deferred until there is an explicit shared-deploy product decision and a real
  design partner.
- A reference corporate deployment guide can be documented earlier as an
  "if you must" path, but it should state the required external controls:
  corporate TLS, trusted reverse proxy, authentication, single-tenant or
  team-scoped instances, safe credential ownership, and operational support.
- Do not sell or separate safety, validation, browser redaction, or diagnostic
  quality into an enterprise-only tier. Commercial-only boundaries may cover
  shared-deploy operations and support, not the safety contract.

### Source Provider Expansion

- Current source support is described in Current Scope. The items below are
  follow-up expansion work, not permission to claim broader provider support.
- Cloudera Manager remains the reference implementation for source-provider
  boundaries. Prefer thin wrappers around existing `query_doctor/cm` helpers
  over rewriting working collectors for tidiness.
- Cloudera Manager version adapter: revisit when real deployments expose newer
  response shapes or metric catalogs that current collectors cannot parse.
- Direct Impala daemon provider: bounded Recent, Running, and Known Query ID
  collection, source provenance, provider-neutral profile context labels,
  profile resource facts, and profile timing facts are implemented. Follow-up
  work should add real fixture coverage, profile action cards, and a normalized
  engine fact contract before broadening provider behavior.
- Prometheus-style metrics provider: implemented as optional direct Impala
  runtime context with allowlisted PromQL, fixed windows, response-size limits,
  and normalized facts only. Follow-up work should add sanitized Ambari/Hadoop
  fixtures and broaden metric profiles only with tests.
- Prepared event/log provider: revisit when event or log sources can provide
  structured cluster events, health alerts, or summarized indexes without raw
  log exposure.
- Hive Metastore metadata backend: revisit only through allowlisted
  parameterized read-only queries over known schema tables and strict output
  bounds.

### Diagnostic Products

- Cluster Doctor as a separate explicit user-run cluster/service/workload window
  diagnostic product. Revisit when per-query diagnosis needs cluster-level
  normalized context often enough that a separate product mode is clearer than
  adding more Details sections. Query Doctor may consume only normalized
  Python-owned context from it.
- Broad workload-level views by query fingerprint, pool, user, table set, and
  time window. Raw-free fingerprint aggregation, baselines, regression signals,
  and minimal outcome tracking are near-term work; broad exploratory workload
  views wait until those safe aggregates exist locally.
- Broad pool/admission operations belong with the deferred Cluster Doctor
  product. Per-query pool/admission diagnosis is near-term only as
  analyzer-owned facts for pool pressure, queue wait, and concurrent load,
  separate from per-query SQL-shape analysis.

### Engines And Storage

Future Big Data SQL/lakehouse engine candidates include Trino, Spark SQL,
StarRocks, Apache Doris, ClickHouse, and Dremio. They require engine-specific
collectors, parsers, metadata allowlists, validators, browser safety tests, and
report coverage before being documented as supported.

Do not claim a second supported engine until Impala diagnosis is useful on real
workloads or a design-partner workload proves cross-engine urgency. A practical
support-claim readiness bar remains `case_primary_bottleneck = unknown` below
roughly 20% on a representative real-case batch, plus the support gates above.
Exploratory fixture-only work can start earlier when it is used to shape the
engine fact contract and stays out of public support surfaces.

Spark SQL is explicitly deferred for now. Its useful diagnostic surface is a
different model from Impala: SQL plans plus per-stage/per-task metrics,
executor behavior, event history, and logs. Treating it as the first second
engine would multiply collector, parser, analyzer, optimizer, validation, and
maintenance cost before the Impala product clears the readiness gate.

Recommended expansion order is documented in
[engine-expansion-plan.md](engine-expansion-plan.md):

1. Harden the current direct Impala daemon source and Prometheus metrics source
   with sanitized real fixture coverage, profile action cards, and normalized
   engine fact contracts.
2. Engine fact contract refactor so analyzer services consume normalized
   parser outputs rather than raw Impala profile internals.
3. Fixture-only second-engine discovery for one named candidate when it answers
   an engine fact-contract question. Trino is the default candidate to validate
   because of migration-path fit, but it is not a public commitment. See
   [engines/trino-diagnostic-contract.md](engines/trino-diagnostic-contract.md)
   for Trino source and evidence rules.
4. Supported second engine only after real design partner demand, collection
   contracts, parser/fact fixtures, metadata allowlists, browser/report safety
   tests, and a support gap matrix.
5. Broaden Prometheus-style metrics profiles only after the first direct Impala
   metrics contract is stable.
6. Storage/table-format facts after provider and engine boundaries stabilize.

Storage and table-format context is a separate axis from query engines. Future
context may cover HDFS, object storage, Apache Kudu, Apache Iceberg, Apache
Hudi, Delta Lake, and engine-internal analytical storage, but only as bounded
read-only normalized facts.

## Repository Direction

The package refactor is in stabilization mode.

- Keep `query_doctor/` under the repository root for now; do not mix a `src/`
  layout migration with feature work.
- Do not add placeholder packages or fake adapters.
- Do not split files only because they are long.
- Split when a feature, safety review, repeated edit conflict, or mixed
  responsibility needs a clearer boundary.
- Keep safety-critical boundaries explicit: raw collection, normalized facts,
  LLM prompt/report writing, deterministic validation, and browser rendering.
- Keep shared browser/report safety helpers under `query_doctor/safety/`.
- Treat `query_doctor/web/trusted_artifacts.py` as a browser trust boundary and
  split it only with dedicated trust-boundary tests.

Good future split boundaries:

- web routes, job orchestration, command builders, presenters, and trusted
  artifact loading;
- report prompt contract, sanitizer, validation, recommendation candidates, and
  LLM client code;
- optimizer parsing, risk classification, validation, recipes, fallback, and
  trusted outcome contracts;
- Cloudera Manager client/config, query discovery, profile collection,
  time-series collection, events collection, and source-provider adapters;
- Impala metadata allowlist, Kerberos/cache handling, shell/protocol execution,
  workflow orchestration, digesting, and analyzer integration.

## Out Of Scope And Anti-Features

These are not deferred backlog items. They require a product-direction change
or a new safety contract before they return.

- AI Copilot UX. The product favors validated facts and explicit rejection over
  speculative suggestions; a Copilot flow would invert that trust contract.
- Auto-fix mode. Query Doctor must not execute user SQL or apply generated SQL.
- Generic SQL execution or OLTP database support.
- Runtime engine selector before engine-specific collectors, parsers,
  metadata allowlists, validators, browser-safety tests, and report coverage
  exist.
- Claiming support for engines without tests.
- Plugin framework before the Impala product is useful end to end.
- Broad package reorganization mixed with feature work.
- Confidence-score inflation. High-certainty wording without high-confidence
  evidence is a silent trust failure.
- Exposing raw SQL, raw profiles, raw metadata, local paths, secrets, model
  names, runtime internals, or raw artifact filenames in browser-visible output
  or trusted reports.

## Known Backlog

- Optimizer trusted SQL draft coverage remains narrow for complex CTE-heavy
  cases.
- More Python-owned optimizer recipes and fixtures are needed before loosening
  prompts.
- Browser model-name redaction must be updated when new provider/model names
  are introduced.
- Batch and pipeline subprocess timeouts may need configuration if real cluster
  runs show current defaults are too strict or too loose.
- More sanitized analyzer fixtures are needed for profile counter edge cases and
  runtime context correlation.
- Documentation drift remains a product risk; active docs should be updated as
  part of safety-sensitive feature work.
- Remote issue triage as of 2026-05-22: safe query-type grouping (#67) and
  optimization score calibration (#68) remain active product backlog; public
  starter/help-wanted issues (#47, #48, #49) remain valid. Scan-side language
  selection (#66) is superseded by config-driven global language selection,
  Known Query ID progress (#69) is implemented, and elapsed-time progress
  display (#70) is partially addressed by elapsed wording/progress tests and
  should either be closed or narrowed during remote issue cleanup.
